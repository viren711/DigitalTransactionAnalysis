Here’s how you can  divide the “DigitalTransactionAnalysis” project among three people  — focusing on  Data Analysis ,  Backend , and  Frontend  roles.

---

     1. Data Analysis (Person 1 — Data Analyst) 

 Main Goal:  Collect, clean, and analyze digital transaction data to extract trends and insights.

     Responsibilities: 

-  Web Scraping: 

  - Scrape transaction data from:

    - RBI website (monthly/annual digital payment reports)
    - NPCI website (UPI, IMPS, RuPay, FASTag data)
    - Annual reports and PDFs if available
  - Use tools like `BeautifulSoup`, `Selenium`, or `requests` for scraping.
-  Data Cleaning & Processing: 

  - Handle missing values, incorrect formats, and duplicates.
  - Convert data into structured CSV/JSON formats.
  - Load cleaned data into a database (MySQL/PostgreSQL).
-  Data Analysis: 

  - Identify growth trends in digital payments (yearly/monthly).
  - Compare payment methods (UPI, NEFT, IMPS, etc.).
  - Perform time-series or statistical analysis for insights.
-  Visualization: 

  - Create visual plots using Python libraries (`matplotlib`, `seaborn`, or `Plotly`).
  - Generate summary reports for backend/frontend integration.

        2. Backend Development (Person 2 — Backend Engineer) 

    Main Goal:  Build the application backend to handle data access, storage, and API-based analysis.

        Responsibilities: 

    -  Database Design: 

    - Design and create database schema for storing transaction data.
    - Handle CRUD operations for data retrieval and updates.
    -  API Development: 

    - Build RESTful APIs using  Flask  to:

        - Fetch data for different time periods or payment types.
        - Serve analytical results and visualizations generated by the Data Analyst.
    - Implement routes like:

        - `/api/get_transactions`
        - `/api/get_trends`
        - `/api/get_summary`
    -  Analysis Integration: 

    - Connect backend with the analysis scripts to run automated insights (e.g., growth rate calculations).
    -  Performance & Security: 

    - Optimize API responses and ensure secure data access.

---

     3. Frontend Development (Person 3 — Frontend Developer) 

 Main Goal:  Build an interactive and visually appealing interface for users to view analysis results.

     Responsibilities: 

-  Frontend Interface: 

  - Use  React.js  (or html/css) for dynamic UI.
  - Design pages for:

    - Dashboard (summary statistics)
    - Trend graphs (UPI growth, NEFT usage, etc.)
    - Comparison charts and insights
-  API Integration: 

  - Connect with backend REST APIs to display real-time or stored data.
  - Handle filtering (e.g., by year, payment type).
-  Data Visualization: 

  - Use libraries like  Chart.js ,  Plotly.js , or  D3.js  for interactive graphs.
-  UI/UX Design: 

  - Ensure simple navigation and clean, professional design.
  - Add search bars, filters, and download buttons.
-  Testing & Deployment: 

  - Test API integration and responsiveness.
  - Deploy frontend with backend (e.g., on Render, Vercel, or Heroku).
