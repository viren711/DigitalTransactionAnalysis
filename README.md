# DigitalTransactionAnalysis

The project gathers digital transaction data from the RBI website, annual reports, and NPCI using web scraping. 
The datasets are stored in a database for easy access and management. 
The data is cleaned and analyzed to find patterns, trends, and meaningful insights about digital payments and its impact. 
Visualizations are created to make the results simple to understand. 
This helps in tracking the growth and changes in digital transactions over time effectively.
